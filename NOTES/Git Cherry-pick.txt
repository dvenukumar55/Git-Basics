git cherry-pick is used to apply a specific commit from one branch to another branch

Instead of merging the whole branch, you pick only the required commit

Basic Syntax:

     git cherry-pick <commit-id>

Multiple Commits:

    git cherry-pick commit1 commit2 commit3

range:

    git cherry-pick commit1..commit5


EG:

Bug fixed in feature-login
Only that fix needed in main

Run:

    git checkout main
    git cherry-pick <fix-commit-id>
    
Only that fix comes to main branch

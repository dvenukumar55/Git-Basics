HEAD is a pointer that tells Git
Which commit / branch you are currently on

eg:

HEAD → main → latest commit

     git checkout main
HEAD points to main

main points to the latest commit

DETACHED HEAD
HEAD points directly to a commit, not to a branch
You are not on any branch

eg:

     git checkout a1b2c3d
     git checkout v1.0

now
HEAD → commit

not attached to any branch

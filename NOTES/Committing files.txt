For commiting file we shouldn't use just

    git commit

we also should give msg also like

     git commit -m "firstcommit"

After that it gives like

     [main (root-commit) 1b2886b] firstcommit
     1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
     create mode 100644 first.txt


1b2886b it is unique num of every commit

git creates a checksum for each commit if any
change happened in code it will changed

actually it is 20 digits but we take 7digits hexadecimal

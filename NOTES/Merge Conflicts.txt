A merge conflict occurs when Git cannot automatically merge changes
because the same part of a file was modified in different branches

Git gets confused about which change to keep

eg:

Branch main:
Hello World

Branch feature:
Hello Kittu


When merging -> conflict

Git shows conflict like this

<<<<<<< HEAD
Hello World
=======
Hello Kittu
>>>>>>> feature


<<<<<<< HEAD → your current branch

======= → separator

>>>>>>> feature → other branch
